To run my program you need 172412-small.py, part7.py, and player2.py

the command to run the program is

python part1.py 172412-small

In my game everything works with a few minor bugs.

bug1 - Music will cause crashes in python3 sporadically
bug2 - playing for too long will cause a segfault in python3
bug3 - Jumping is a mess
bug4 - I didn't realize that we weren't turning in one master file, so I worked sporadically and ended up with a
       a single python file, part7.py, to run....

feature1 - In true ninja fashion, if you try to run across platforms that are close together but have a single gap
           in between then you will not fall.

feature2 - My ninja felt slow so he is a bit faster, as all real ninjas should be
