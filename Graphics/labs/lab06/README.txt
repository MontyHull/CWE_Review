Progress:
I have completed the entire lab including the challenge problem.

In the challenge problem I have added the capability to change the color of the dodgeball to either red,blue or green
by typing r,g, or b on the keyboard.

I have also added the ability to teleport. If you press t on the keyboard you will be randomly teleported to one
of the four cornes of the board. If you continue to hit it you will move to the next corner going clockwise
around the board.
