This repository is  to show some of my previous coding work that I did while at USNA.

AI - A connect 4 game written in python 

Graphics - 1) Multiple small to large python programs that make 2D and 3D images.
		   2) Uses many libraries such as OpenGL, Numpy, and Pyglet

Languages - 1) Writing a compiler in c++ for a calculator language
			2) A few Golang programs

Research -  My research project that I did with Dr. Roche and a fellow midshipman Lucia Lee. 
			This project was to see if we could find a way to use a super computer to find
			a solution to small, fixed sized, polynomial equations that had a theoretical lower bound,
			but the lower bound had not been captured in an algorithm yet. The research was a success, 
			but it was bound to extremely small equations.
